```bash
# Create folder structure
mkdir -p SwarmLead-Investor-Pack/{documents,feedback,analytics,.obsidian/plugins}

## Alternative: Simple Git + Markdown

### Setup for Technical Investors

```bash
# Initialize git repo
git init SwarmLead-Briefcase
cd SwarmLead-Briefcase

# Create branches for each investor
git checkout -b investor-alice
git checkout -b investor-bob

# They make changes/comments directly in files
# You can see exactly what they changed
git diff main investor-alice
```

### Track Engagement with Git

```bash
# See when files were accessed
git log --follow documents/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

# See what parts they focused on
git blame documents/TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_OVERVIEW.md

# Generate activity report
git shortlog -sn --since="1 week ago"
```

## Privacy-First Analytics

### Option 1: Local Plausible Analytics
```javascript
// Simple JavaScript tracker (no external calls)
const tracker = {
  documentOpened: (doc) => {
    const log = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('swarmLead') || '{}');
    log[doc] = {
      firstView: log[doc]?.firstView || Date.now(),
      lastView: Date.now(),
      viewCount: (log[doc]?.viewCount || 0) + 1
    };
    localStorage.setItem('swarmLead', JSON.stringify(log));
  }
};
```

### Option 2: CSV Logging
Create `tracking-template.csv`:
```csv
Investor,Document,Date,TimeSpent,ScrollDepth,Comments
Alice,Executive Summary,2024-01-15,12m,100%,3
Alice,Tech Overview,2024-01-15,25m,80%,5
```
